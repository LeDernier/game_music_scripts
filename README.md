# Sonic Pi based game music scripts

As I like to develop video games, I try sometimes to create some music for those. Especially for the games I create during a Game Jam.
I uses [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), the live coding music synth, because it fits with my way of thinking music. You can find the project repository on [github](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi).
The aim of this repository is to help people that may need some more examples to build their music with.

The scripts you can find in this repository were used for the following video games :

* [Abyss](https://7fault.itch.io/abyss)
* [Bubble Hell](https://7fault.itch.io/bubble-hell)

## Getting Started

Clone or download the project and unzip it. All the .txt files are music scripts that you can load and use with Sonic Pi.
